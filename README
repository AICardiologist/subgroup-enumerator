This repository will host a Python package, `subgroup_enumerator`, which enumerates subgroups of finite groups. The project will be managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

Once implemented, the package will provide `enumerate_subgroups` in `subgroup_enumerator/group_theory.py`.
Unit tests can be run with:
